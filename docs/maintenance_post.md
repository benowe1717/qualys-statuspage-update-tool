# StatusPage Update Tool - Maintenance Post

## When should I make this post?

Maintenance Posts are for any type of update/post where a new release is coming or scheduled downtime is occurring. These are *not* active outages or issues.

## How do I make a Title?

To generate an Maintenance Post Title:

1. Navigate to the following URL: https://qualys.projecttiy.com/status_page.php
2. Select the Scheduled Maintenance Update tab
3. Select the affected Platform in the dropdown menu
4. Enter in the Title (without the Platform)
    - Example: File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) 3.8.0.0 Release Notification

5. Click the **Generate Title** button
6. Confirm that the title appears in the green message box below the form
7. Click the **Copy to Clipboard** button
    - If the button text changes to **Copied!**, then the text has been copied successfully

## How do I make a Message?

To generate a Maintenance Message:

- *If you've already generated a title, skip to step 3*
1. Navigate to the following URL: https://qualys.projecttiy.com/status_page.php
2. Select the Scheduled Maintenance Update tab
3. Enter in the Ticket Number
    - **NOTE**: This should be in a format such as CMB-123456 (2-3 letters, a hypen, then digits)

4. Enter in the Message
    - Example: A new release of File Integrity Monitoring 3.8.0.0 (FIM) is going to be released into production. The deployment is completely transparent to users and no impact is expected.

5. Enter in the Reference Link
    - **NOTE**: This should be in URL format such as https://www.qualys.com/docs/release-notes/qualys-file-integrity-monitoring-3.8-release-notes.pdf (http:// or https:// is required)
    - **NOTE**: If you need to specify *multiple* reference links, then please separate the links by comma (,). For example: https://qualys.com/release-notes/, https://qualys.com is *valid* but https://qualys.com/release-notes/https://qualys.com is *not valid*

6. Click the **Generate Message** button
7. Confirm that the message appears in the green message box below the form
8. Click the **Copy to Clipboard** button
    - If the button text changes to **Copied!**, then the text has been copied successfully

## What if I get an Error?

Any error messages will appear below the form in a red message box. Double-check that you've selected a Platform and filled in the Title and/or Message with something that makes sense. Please also make sure you've followed the proper formatting for the Ticket Number and Reference Link. If you still receive errors or something doesn't appear to be working:

1. Navigate to the following URL: https://form.asana.com/?k=5NujZDZAckLzuZLt1PsX4w&d=7181608527677
2. Fill in your Name and Email Address
3. Select the **Support Tools** Topic
4. Enter in the error you received and any steps you used to reproduce the issue
5. If you have any screenshots of the error, please attach them to the form
6. Click **Submit** to put in a request with the Support Operations team

**NOTE**: If this is urgent, please reach out to Benjamin Owen on Teams.
