# StatusPage Update Tool - Incident Post

## When should I make this post?

Incident Posts are for any type of update/post where an active issue/outage is occurring. The types of Incidents will be:

2. Select the Incident Update tab
3. Select the affected Platform in the dropdown menu
4. Enter in the Title (without the Platform)
    - Example: QualysGuard UI is not accessible

5. Click the **Generate Title** button
6. Confirm that the title appears in the green message box below the form
7. Click the **Copy to Clipboard** button
    - If the button text changes to **Copied!**, then the text has been copied successfully

## How do I make a Message?

To generate an Incident Message:

- *If you've already generated a title, skip to step 3*

## What if I get an Error?

Any error messages will appear below the form in a red message box. Double-check that you've selected a Platform and filled in the Title and/or Message with something that makes sense. If you still receive errors or something doesn't appear to be working:

5. If you have any screenshots of the error, please attach them to the form
6. Click **Submit** to put in a request with the Support Operations team

**NOTE**: If this is urgent, please reach out to Benjamin Owen on Teams.
