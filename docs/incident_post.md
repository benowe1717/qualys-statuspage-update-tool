# StatusPage Update Tool - Incident Post

## When should I make this post?

Incident Posts are for any type of update/post where an active issue/outage is occurring. The types of Incidents will be:
- Degraded Performance
- Partial Outage
- Major Outage

## How do I make a post?

To generate an Incident Post:

1. Navigate to the following URL: https://qualys.projecttiy.com/status_page#incident-tab
2. Select the affected Platform in the dropdown menu
3. Enter in the Title (without the Platform)
    - Example: QualysGuard UI is not accessible

4. Enter in the Message
    - Example: Users are not able to access QualysGuard for KSA Platform 1. Cloud Platform Operations team is actively investigating and further updates will be shared as they are received.

5. Click the **Generate post** button
6. Confirm that the message appears in the green message box below the form
7. To get the correctly formatted Title or Message, click either the **Copy Title to Clipboard** or **Copy Message to Clipboard** button
    - If the button text changes to **Copied!**, then the text has been copied successfully

## What if I get an Error?

Any error messages will appear below the form in a red message box. Double-check that you've selected a Platform and filled in the Title and/or Message with something that makes sense. If you still receive errors or something doesn't appear to be working:

1. Navigate to the following URL: https://github.com/benowe1717/qualys-statuspage-update-tool/issues
2. Click the green **New issue** button
3. Fill in the title with a brief summary of your issue
4. Fill in the description with any errors you received and any steps you used to reproduce the issue
5. If you have any screenshots of the error, please attach them to the issue
6. Click the green **Submit new issue** button to open an issue
