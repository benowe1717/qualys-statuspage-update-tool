# StatusPage Update Tool

StatusPage Update Tool is a `tool` that allows `Managers and Leads` to create `a properly formatted Status Post` based on an update type.

With the recently revamped StatusPage UI, posts must be formatted in a specific format so that the page is properly formatted and organized. This tool makes the formatting simple by providing a form for users to fill in and then generate a properly formatted Title and Message. The form will handle validation and formatting for you and provides the ability to copy the formatted message straight to your clipboard.
